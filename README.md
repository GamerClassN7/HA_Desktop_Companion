# HA_Desktop_Companion
Why did I make this app ? 

Cause I don't like existing implementations using MQTT and I took inspiration from awesome ESPhome and its native communication protocol to HA and implemented it my own way :)

Feel free to contribute any time :)

## Sensors implemented currently:
- battery_level
- battery_state
- is_charging
- wifi_ssid

## Future plans:
- Simple configuration of sensors in YAML
- Improved debug mode
- Encryption
